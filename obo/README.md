This folder contains the context files for mapping DATS to the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) ontologies.

We have identified some entities and properties that are not available within the OBO ontologies, and this has been indicated as ```TODO``` on the mapping files, until those terms are added to the relevant ontologies.

The list of missing terms, which we will request to the relevant ontologies are:
- has_license (for dataset_distribution)
- conformsTo (for dataset_distribution)
- format (for dataset_distribution)
